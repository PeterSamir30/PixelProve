# PixelProve
PixelProve is an AI-powered image integrity detection system designed to verify the authenticity of images. It employs two deep learning models to detect both AI-generated visuals and deepfake facial manipulations. Open-source and built for real-world applications, this project aims to enhance digital media security and trust.
